## Hi, I'm Nate 👋

Senior software engineer based in Portland, Oregon. I've been building for the web since I was a kid. I care about open standards, small sharp tools, and software that lasts.

Currently working on the Platform team at [Optibus](https://www.optibus.com), where I help maintain and evolve GTFS pipelines and integrations. Before that, I led engineering at [Scripto](https://scripto.live), a real-time collaborative screenwriting platform used in production by The Daily Show, The Late Show, and others.

## Background

15+ years working professionally as a software engineer, from agencies to startups, product to platform, across the stack from front to back. My open source code on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~ungoldman) has been downloaded over 4 million times in the past year.

Open web advocate. Erstwhile community organizer. Occasional writer.
