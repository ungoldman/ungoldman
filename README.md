## Hi, I'm Nate 👋

Senior software engineer based in Portland, Oregon. I've been building for the web since I was a kid. I care about open standards, small sharp tools, and software that lasts.

Currently working on the Platform team at [Optibus](https://www.optibus.com), where I help maintain and evolve GTFS pipelines and integrations. Before that, I led engineering at [Scripto](https://scripto.live), a real-time collaborative screenwriting platform used in production by The Daily Show, The Late Show, and others.

## What I'm working on

- Transit data tooling and GTFS API work at Optibus
- Occasional small tools that scratch specific itches

## Background

15+ years working professionally as a software engineer, from agencies to startups, product to platform, across the stack from front to back. Open source packages I've personally authored have been downloaded over 4 million times in the past year (last checked February 2026).

Open web advocate. Erstwhile community organizer. Occasional writer.
